### Book Blurb

> Asyncio is an exciting new addition to Python.
>
> It allows regular Python programs to be developed using the asynchronous programming paradigm.
>
> It includes changes to the language to support coroutines as first-class objects, such as the `async def` and `await` expressions, and the lesser discussed `async for` and `async with` expressions for asynchronous iterators and context managers respectively.
>
> Asyncio is the way to rapidly develop scalable Python programs capable of tens or hundreds of thousands of concurrent tasks.
>
> Developing concurrent programs using coroutines and the `asyncio` module API can be very challenging for beginners, especially those new to asynchronous programming.
>
> Introducing: "Python Asyncio Jump-Start". A new book designed to teach you asyncio in Python, super fast!
>
> You will get a rapid-paced, 7-part course focused on getting you started and make you awesome at using asyncio.
>
> Including:
>
> * How to define, schedule, and execute asynchronous tasks as coroutines.
> * How to manage groups of asynchronous tasks, including waiting for al tasks, the first that, or the first task to fail.
> * How to define, create, and use asynchronous iterators, generators, and context manages
> * How to share data between coroutines with quests and how to synchronize coroutines to make code coroutine-safe.
> * How to run commands as subprocesses and how to implement asynchronous socket programming with streams.
> * How to develop a port scanner that is nearly 1,000 times faster than the sequential version.
>
> Each of the 7 lessons was carefully designed to teach one critical aspect of asyncio, with explanations, code snippets, and complete examples.
>
> Each lesson ends with an exercise for you to complete to confirm you understood the topic, a summary of what was learned, and links for further reading if you want to go deeper.
>
> Stop copy-pasting code from StackOverflow answers.
>
> Learn Python concurrency correctly, step-by-step.
